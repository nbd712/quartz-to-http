# Quartz Protocol Converter

## Background
This is intended to interface Evertz Magnum server names with devices that do not natively. My use case is for a TSL/Wholer MADI audio monitor, but I'm sure it could be adapted for something else.

## To Run
To run, create a Quartz interface in your Magnum system. Right now, each MADI monitor needs it's own Quartz interface with the proper destinations and sources available. Just add your device info at the top and it should be good to go.


## Development
I plan to add functions to interface with the audio monitor. I'm working on functionality first, then I'll make it pretty.


Note: I'm not a real programmer so please excuse the odd variable names and poor organization. I'll  redo it eventually.
