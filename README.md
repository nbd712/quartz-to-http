# Quartz Protocol Converter

## Background
This is intended to interface Evertz Magnum server names with devices that do not natively. My use case is for a TSL/Wholer MADI audio monitor, but I'm sure it could be adapted for something else.

## To Run
To run make sure you have superuser privliges. All you need to do is add your devices into the "devices" list in the correct format and it should work...hopefully.


## Development
I plan to add functions to interface with the audio monitor. I'm working on funcationality first, then I'll make it pretty.


Note: I'm not a real programmer so please excuse the odd variable names and poor organization. I might redo it eventually.
